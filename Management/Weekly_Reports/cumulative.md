- Clarified roles and responsibilities to set clear expectations for project contributions and accountability.  
- Briefly discussed the next steps, including key deliverables and upcoming tasks.

## Challenges

- Fully understand the project scope and its technical requirements.  
- Defining a clear MVP to prioritize essential features and to organize the development.

## Plan for Next Week

Ensure that the documentation is started, especially on management side and the functional specification, since they are the first deadlines.

## Conclusion  
This week was focused on launching the project, clarifying expectations, and aligning the team. While we made progress in understanding roles and preparing the next steps, we need to refine our understanding of the project scope and define a clear MVP to optimize development.

# Weekly Report - Week 3

## Overview  
This week marked a turning point finalizing the remaining documentation. The focus was split between wrapping up the functional phase and initiating the implementation of core features.

## Accomplishments

- The functional specification was finalized and delivered.  
- The technical specification and test plan both reached 20% completion.  
- Continued work on the project charter, now fully completed.

## Challenges

- Managing workload across the team, especially with one member working remotely.  
- Feature 3 took more time than expected due to complexity in logic/implementation.

## Plan for Next Week

- Finalize the technical specification and test plan.  
- Continue development of Feature 3 and begin new features.  
- Start preparing the user manual structure and collect content.  
- Plan internal test sessions based on progress.

## Conclusion  
Week 3 was productive, as we transitioned from planning to execution. With two features completed and documentation progressing well, the project is moving forward at a solid pace. Remaining tasks are clearly identified for the coming week.
