# Weekly Report - Week 3

## Overview  
This week marked a turning point finalizing the remaining documentation. The focus was split between wrapping up the functional phase and initiating the implementation of core features.

## Accomplishments

- The functional specification was finalized and delivered. 
- The technical specification and test plan both reached 20% completion.  
- Continued work on the project charter, now fully completed.

## Challenges

- Managing workload across the team, especially with one member working remotely.  
- Feature 3 took more time than expected due to complexity in logic/implementation.  

## Plan for Next Week

- Finalize the technical specification and test plan.  
- Start preparing the user manual structure and collect content.  
- Plan internal test sessions based on progress.

## Conclusion  
Week 3 was productive, as we transitioned from planning to execution. With two features completed and documentation progressing well, the project is moving forward at a solid pace. Remaining tasks are clearly identified for the coming week.
