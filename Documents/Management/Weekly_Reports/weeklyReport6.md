# Weekly Report - Week 6

## Overview  
This week, the team finalized the last official deliverable and began preparing for the oral presentation. With documentation and development now complete, the focus has swapped to polishing the project and organizing the upcoming oral presentation and live demo.

## Accomplishments

- The user manual was finalized and submitted by the April 1st deadline.  
- Internal testing and review of the full pipeline were done.  
- Initial work began on oral presentation slides and planning.  
- The team outlined who will present what, and rehearsals are being scheduled.

## Challenges

- Two members are unavailable, which adds organizational complexity to the oral presentation.  
- Managing timing and distribution of speaking roles has become trickier with only 5 out of 7 present.  
- Coordinating rehearsals is more difficult with partial availability.

## Plan for Next Week

- Finalize and rehearse the oral presentation.  
- Ensure that missing teammates' workload is redistributed smoothly.  
- Prepare visual support (demo and slides) for the final delivery.  

## Conclusion  
With all technical and written deliverables submitted on time, Week 6 has marked the transition into final preparations. Despite two missing team members, the group is adapting and working to deliver a well-structured oral presentation next week.
